Project theme: The effect of natural gas prices on coal plants retireme


Description: The purpose of this study is to use panel data econometric models to quantify the effect of falling gas prices on coal plants retirements in the US. Currently, coal power capacity is at a historical low level. Researchers suggest some possible explanations for this fast decline: the increase of renewable energy capacities, the presence of CO2 markets, the decline of natural gas prices, the economics crisis or other complementary environmental policies. This study will attempt to quantitavely assign capacity decline to natural gas availabilty and other factors using data from the US electric power sector.
